## Blob

A blob is a contiguous chunk of binary data stored as a single entity. Blobs can represent parts of or whole files, but are typically treated as opaque entities that make up more meaningful data structures.

## Replica

A replica is a one-to-one pairing of a software process and data storage location. The software process is a server that accepts client requests for data and responds to them, while also ensuring that local data is replicated according to a variety of rules to other replicas. Replicas are configured with storage and communication mechanisms in order to ensure they do their jobs.

## Scaling

A system is scaled by adding more resources -- both computational (CPU, memory) and storage (disk space). There are two primary forms of scaling: vertical scaling is the increase of resources by improving single machines, while horizontal scaling is the addition of more machines.

## Shard

A shard is a partition of a larger database that is intended to be smaller, faster, and more easily managed. The word shard means a small part of a whole, and shards can be replicated to provide even more throughput and availability.
